# Main

## Halfdan Rydbeck

I do network and pathway enrichemnt analyis of \[plasma proteomics
data\] (<https://github.com/halryd/Neored>), I worked with system setup,
user management, data delivery and down stream analysis of Illumina and
Pacbio sequence data at the Norewegian DNA sequenicing center. In my
\[PhD thesis\]((<https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/39398>) projects I
analysed gene expression, promoter methylation, histone occupancy and
copynumber variation data with R and Galaxy [the Genomic
Hyperbrowser](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/hb/#!mode=basic).
